# Introduction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict credit risk using historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify the creditworthiness of borrowers, distinguishing between healthy loans and high-risk loans.

# Project Overview
In this project, I performed the following tasks:

* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Created a logistic regression model with the original data.
* Resampled the training data using the RandomOverSampler technique.
* Fit a logistic regression model with the resampled training data.
* Evaluated the performance of both models by calculating accuracy scores, generating confusion matrices, and printing classification reports.

# What I Did
* Loaded the lending data into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
* Built a logistic regression model using the original data and evaluated its performance.
* Resampled the training data using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library.
& Fitted a logistic regression model with the resampled training data and assessed its performance.

# Tools Used
* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* imbalanced-learn

# What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in several areas, including:
* Data preprocessing and manipulation using Pandas.
* Building and evaluating logistic regression models for credit risk classification.
* Resampling techniques to address class imbalance.
* Model evaluation using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

# Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into credit risk classification using machine learning techniques. The logistic regression models demonstrated strong performance in predicting both healthy loans and high-risk loans. By leveraging resampling techniques, such as the RandomOverSampler, the model achieved improved performance on the high-risk loan class. The project showcased my ability to handle real-world data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance. The skills and knowledge gained from this project are directly applicable to solving credit risk problems in the lending industry.
